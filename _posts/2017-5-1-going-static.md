prior to this i had no idea what jekyll was but heres my first post. this is all it is, just a basic website with flat content, no database, no cms, and hosted for free on github. i figure theres no easier way to get a personal site on the net than this. and at this point in my life, installing ruby, rails, and jekyll locally for what is just my personal site is the mental equivilent of punching myself in the face. but yeah, i totally dig this static site concept for basic sites and will definately get more into jekyll in teh future. 

ok then, jekyll, that was super easy. thanks for that.
