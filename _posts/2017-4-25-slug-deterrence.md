title: gardening tip, slug deterrence
---
most people poison slugs, but they may not know that slugs have a weakness to coffee. they hate coffee. because they're... slugs.

you just want to collect up your coffee grounds from a day of drinking coffee, let them sit for a while to cool down, and then sprinkle them around your vegetables. if you're impatient and you want to sprinkle them immediately after a coffee, that's probably ok too. 

and there you have it, gardeners. slugless vegetables.

here's a couple of pics from my little garden out the front with some cauliflowers. you will notice no slugs.
