gardening tips, slug deterrence:

most people poison slugs, but they may not know that slugs have a weakness. coffee. they hate coffee. because they're... slugs.

you just want to collect up your coffee grounds from a day of drinking coffee, let them sit for a while to cool down, and then sprinkle them around your vegetables. if you're impatient and you want to sprinkle them immediately after a coffee, that's probably ok too. 

and there you have it, gardeners. you now have slugless vegetables.

here's a couple of pics from my little garden out the front with some slug protected cauliflowers.
