prior to this i had no idea what jekyll was but heres my first post. this is all it is, just a basic website with static content and hosted for free on github. i figure theres no cheaper and easier way to get a personal site on the net than this. im making the choice to take the easy route because at this point in my life i have more important things to do and im also really lazy. but yeah, i definately dig this static site concept for basic sites and i will definately get more under the hood of jekyll in the future. 

ok then, jekyll, that was super easy, thanks. and thanks also to barryclark and his useful post on jekyll here: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/. and to wordpress, im really sorry, but this means we're breaking up. look at it this way, you're better than jekyll, but i just want to simplify my life, you know?
