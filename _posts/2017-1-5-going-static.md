prior to this i had no idea what jekyll was but heres my first post. this is all it is, just a basic website with static content, no database, no cms, and hosted for free on github. i figure theres no cheaper and easier way to get a personal site on the net than this. im making the choice to take the easy route because at this point in my life i have things to do and im also really lazy. i could install ruby and jekyll on my local server and customise the whole thing into a big production but for a personal website - that is the mental equivilent of punching myself in the face. but yeah, i definately dig this static site concept for basic sites and i will definately get more under the hood of jekyll in teh future. 

ok then, jekyll, that was super easy, thanks. and wordpress, im really sorry, but this means we're breaking up. look at it this way, you're better than jekyll, but i just want to simplify my life, you know?
