prior to this i had no idea what [jekyll](http://www.github.com/jekyll) was but heres my first post. this is all it is, just a basic website with static content and hosted for free on github. theres no cheaper and easier way to get a personal site on the net than this. im making the choice to take the easy route because at this point in my life i have more important things to do than muck around with wordpress and im also really lazy. but yeah, i definately dig this static site concept for basic sites and i will definately get more under the hood of jekyll in the future.
